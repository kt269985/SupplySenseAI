# SupplySense AI

**AI-powered platform helping small businesses find U.S.-based suppliers, forecast product costs, and adapt to changing economic conditions.**

---

## 💡 Why We Built This

Small businesses across America — especially in rural or underserved areas — face increasing challenges from supply chain instability, inflation, and tariff shifts. While large corporations have access to sophisticated tools, many local businesses are left guessing.

**SupplySense AI levels the playing field** by giving small business owners an AI-powered assistant that helps them make smarter sourcing and budgeting decisions.
